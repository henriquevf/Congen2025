## **Section 1: Long-Term Demographic History with PSMC**

**About PSMC**

PSMC (Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent) models long-term population size changes using heterozygous sites in a single diploid genome.

**Input Requirements**

1.	Diploid genome in FASTA format.

2.	Mask file indicating callable regions.

## Data preparation

**Step 1: Generate Consensus Sequence**

Use samtools to call variants and create a diploid consensus sequence:

```bash
bcftools mpileup -Ou -f <reference> <bam_file> | bcftools call -c | [vcfutils.pl](http://vcfutils.pl/) vcf2fq -d 10 -D 100 > <output.fq
```

- `bcftools mpileup`:
    - `-f <reference.fa>`: Specifies the reference genome FASTA file against which reads in input.bam are aligned.
    - `input.bam`: The BAM file containing aligned sequencing reads for the individual genome.
    - **Purpose**: Identifies variant sites in the input BAM file, calculating genotype likelihoods.
- `bcftools call -c`:
    - `-c`: Performs consensus calling for genotypes at variant sites.
    - **Purpose**: Assigns genotypes at variant sites based on likelihood estimates.
- `vcfutils.pl`: A Perl script from the SAMtools package used to process VCF files.
    - `vcf2fq`: Converts a VCF file into a FASTQ-like format that records consensus sequence information.
    - `-d 10`: Sets the minimum read depth threshold (e.g., only consider positions with at least 10 reads supporting the genotype).
    - `-D 100`: Sets the maximum read depth threshold to filter out regions with excessively high coverage (indicative of duplications or sequencing errors).
    - `variants.vcf`: Input VCF file containing variant calls.
    - `> output.fq`: Redirects the output to a file named consensus.fq.
    - **Purpose**: Produces a consensus sequence in FASTQ format for downstream analysis.

**Step 2: Convert to PSMC Format**

Convert the consensus FASTQ to PSMC input format:

```bash
fq2psmcfa -q20 consensus.fq > diploid.psmcfa
```

- `fq2psmcfa`: A tool from the PSMC package that converts a FASTQ-like file into the PSMC input format.
    - `-q20`: Filters out bases with a quality score below 20, ensuring only high-confidence bases are retained.
    - `consensus.fq`: Input FASTQ-like file from Step 1.
    - `> diploid.psmcfa`: Redirects the output to a file named diploid.psmcfa, which is required for the PSMC analysis.
    - **Purpose**: Prepares the data for PSMC by creating a diploid consensus file in .psmcfa format.

## Running PSMC

**Step 3: Run PSMC**

Run the PSMC analysis:

```bash
psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p "4+25*2+4+6" -o output.psmc diploid.psmcfa
```

- `psmc`: Main executable for running the PSMC model.
    - `-N25`: Sets the maximum number of iterations to 25 for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
    - `-t15`: Specifies the initial value for the time segment parameter. This helps determine the resolution of population size changes over time.
    - `-r5`: Specifies the initial value for the mutation rate scaling factor. A higher value allows finer scaling of mutation rates during optimization.
    - `-p "4+25*2+4+6"`:
        - This parameter defines the pattern of time intervals for coalescent events.
        - `4`: Represents the first 4 intervals with finer resolution.
        - `25*2`: Indicates 25 intervals with a constant width scaled by 2.
        - `4+6`: Indicates the last 4 intervals followed by 6 broader intervals.
    - `-o output.psmc`: Specifies the output file for the results of the PSMC analysis.
    - `diploid.psmcfa`: Input file generated in Step 2.
    
    ### A brief note on the “-p” parameter
    
    The -p **parameter in PSMC** controls how the program splits time into intervals for estimating population sizes. Think of it as dividing the timeline of a species’ history into chunks to see how the population changed over time.
    
    **Simple Explanation:**
    
    - **Imagine a timeline** of your species’ past.
    - **The** -p **value decides** how many chunks (time intervals) the timeline is divided into and how detailed each chunk is.
    - For example, **“4+25*2+4+6”** means:
    - **4 early chunks**: Very detailed near the present (fine-grained for recent history).
    - **25 chunks scaled by 2**: Less detailed as we go further back in time.
    - **4 + 6 chunks**: Even broader for ancient times, summarizing big changes.
    
    The idea is to have **more detail for recent times** (because we know more) and **less detail for ancient times** (where the data is fuzzier).
    
    **Analogy:**
    
    Think of looking at a city map:
    
    •	**Recent times (near your home)**: Zoom in and see every street (more chunks, detailed).
    
    •	**Ancient times (far from home)**: Zoom out and only see highways (fewer chunks, summarized).
    
    This division lets PSMC focus on changes we can measure well while not overanalyzing parts of the timeline with limited data.
    

## Data visualization

**Step 4: Visualize Results**

Use the `psmc_plot.pl` script to generate a plot:

```bash
psmc_plot.pl -g <generation_time> -u <mutation_rate> -p output output.psmc
```

- `psmc_plot.pl`: A Perl script provided with the PSMC package to visualize results.
    - Generates plots of inferred population size changes over time.
    - `-g <generation_time>`: Specifies the generation time (e.g., 5 years for some mammals). Replace <generation_time> with the appropriate value for your species.
    - `-u <mutation_rate>`: Specifies the mutation rate per base pair per generation (e.g., 1.25e-8 for humans). Replace <mutation_rate> with the appropriate value for your species.
    - `-p output`: Sets the prefix for output plot files (e.g., output.svg or output.png).
    - `output.psmc`: Input file from Step 3 containing the PSMC results.
    - **Purpose**: Creates a visual representation of the inferred demographic history.

### **Interpreting the PSMC Plot**

The PSMC plot has two axes:

- **X-Axis (Time in Years Before Present)**:
    - Represents historical time, calibrated based on generation time and mutation rate.
    - Recent history is on the left, while older history is on the right.
- **Y-Axis (Effective Population Size, Ne)**:
    - Represents the effective population size, an estimate of the number of breeding individuals in a population over time.

**Key Features to Look For:**

1.	**Peaks**: Indicate periods of population expansion (e.g., favorable environmental conditions or reduced competition).

2.	**Troughs**: Reflect population bottlenecks, where the population size was significantly reduced (e.g., due to habitat loss, climate change, or human activity).

3.	**Flat Regions**: Suggest stable population sizes over long periods, indicating a balance between reproduction and mortality.

### Elephants mutation rate and generation time

```bash
0.6e-8  **to**  1.0xe-8  **substitutions per site per generation.**
```

```bash
25 years generation time
```

**Key Considerations:**

1.	**Generation Time**:

Elephants have long generation times (typically ~**25 years** for African elephants), which plays a role in how mutation rates are calculated. Longer generation times may lead to lower per-year mutation rates compared to species with shorter lifespans.

2.	**Species-Specific Variation**:

- Mutation rates might differ between African elephants (*Loxodonta africana*), Asian elephants (*Elephas maximus*), and other elephantids (e.g., extinct species like mammoths).
- Rates can also depend on the specific genomic regions studied (e.g., coding vs. non-coding DNA).

## **Error Prevention**

**Step 1: Generate Consensus Sequence**

- **Input File Verification**:
    - Ensure the BAM file is properly sorted and indexed using `samtools sort` and `samtools index`.
    - Verify the reference FASTA file is indexed (`samtools faidx`) and matches the BAM file.
- **Parameter Consistency**:
    - Check that read depth thresholds (`-d` and `-D`) are appropriate for your dataset’s coverage.
- **Output File Check**:
    - Verify that the FASTQ output is generated and not empty (`ls -lh <output.fq>`).

**Step 2: Convert to PSMC Format**

- **Consensus File Integrity**: Ensure the consensus FASTQ file is complete and contains valid data before conversion.
- **Quality Filtering**: Adjust the quality threshold (`-q20`) if the dataset has unusually low-quality reads.

**Step 3: Run PSMC**

- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Use trial runs with different parameters (`-N`, `-t`, `-r`, `-p`) to test the sensitivity of results.
- **Computational Resources**: Check the job submission script for resource allocation (e.g., nodes, time limit) to avoid premature termination.
- **Intermediate Checks**: Monitor the log file generated by PSMC to ensure the program is running without errors.

**Step 4: Visualize Results**

- **Parameter Validation**: Confirm that generation time (`-g`) and mutation rate (`-u`) are biologically accurate for your species.
- **Output Files**: Check that the plot files are generated and properly saved in the specified directory.

**General Troubleshooting Tips**:

- **Dependencies**: Ensure required tools (`bcftools`, `vcfutils.pl`, `fq2psmcfa`, `psmc`) are installed and accessible in your environment.
- **Log Errors**: Review standard output (`.o` files) and error logs (`.e` files) from job submissions for debugging.
- **Environment**: Ensure all required modules are loaded in the HPC environment (e.g., `module load bcftools`, `module load psmc`).
- **Storage Space**: Verify sufficient disk space for large intermediate files generated during the workflow.

## Questions:

1. What happens to the plot if you change the mutation rate? And the generation time?
2. What can you about the evolutionary history of savanna and forest elephants based on the PSMC trajectory?
3. What conservation recommendations can you make based on the results?
4. What other analyses would you suggest to have a finer and more recent scale?
