# Sequencing and data quality

**Sequencing and Data Quality Tutorial for Conservation Genomics**

This tutorial will guide you through the essential steps to evaluate and preprocess sequencing data, focusing on FASTQ file handling, quality assessment using **FastQC**, and data trimming with **Fastp**. These steps are critical for ensuring high-quality inputs for downstream analyses in conservation genomics.

**Section 1: Understanding Sequencing Output – FASTQ Files**

FASTQ files are the standard format for storing raw sequencing data. Each read in a FASTQ file consists of four lines:

1.	**Sequence Identifier**: Starts with @ and includes metadata.

2.	**Nucleotide Sequence**: The sequence of DNA bases (A, T, G, C).

3.	**Separator Line**: Starts with + and may repeat the identifier.

4.	**Quality Scores**: ASCII-encoded quality values corresponding to each base in the sequence.

**Exercise: View a FASTQ File**

1.	Navigate to the directory containing your FASTQ file:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/data
```

2.	Use less to inspect the file:

```bash
less your_data.fastq
```

Scroll through the lines to identify the structure described above.

3.	Count the number of reads (each read has four lines):

```bash
wc -l your_data.fastq
```

Divide the total number of lines by 4 to calculate the number of reads.

**Section 2: Evaluating Data Quality with FastQC**

FastQC is a widely used tool for evaluating sequencing data quality. It generates a detailed report that includes metrics like:

- **Per Base Quality**: Average quality scores across the length of reads.
- **GC Content**: The percentage of G and C bases.
- **Duplicate Levels**: Identifies potential PCR duplicates.
- **Adapter Content**: Checks for residual sequencing adapters.

**Installing FastQC**

If FastQC is not installed on your HPC, load it using a module:

```bash
module load fastqc
```

**Running FastQC**

1.	Create a directory for output:

```bash
mkdir fastqc_reports
```

2.	Run FastQC on a single file:

```bash
fastqc your_data.fastq -o fastqc_reports
```

3.	Run FastQC on all FASTQ files in the directory:

```bash
fastqc *.fastq -o fastqc_reports
```

**Viewing the Results**

- Navigate to the fastqc_reports directory and download the *_fastqc.html files to your local machine using scp or rsync.
- Open the HTML file in a browser to examine the quality metrics.

**Section 3: Trimming and Filtering with Fastp**

Fastp is an efficient tool for quality control and preprocessing. It can:

- Trim low-quality bases.
- Remove adapters.
- Filter short reads.
- Generate QC reports.

**Installing Fastp**

Load Fastp on your HPC:

```bash
module load fastp
```

**Running Fastp**

1.	Trim a single file:

```bash
fastp -i your_data.fastq -o your_data_trimmed.fastq
```

Key parameters:

- `-i`: Input file.
- `-o`: Output file.

2.	Trim paired-end reads:

```bash
fastp -i read1.fastq -I read2.fastq -o read1_trimmed.fastq -O read2_trimmed.fastq
```

3.	Include a summary report:

```bash
fastp -i your_data.fastq -o your_data_trimmed.fastq --html fastp_report.html
```

4.	Trim all files in a directory using a loop:

```bash
#!/bin/sh -l
#SBATCH -A bio240351  
#SBATCH -p wholenode 
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1  # fastp uses internal parallelism
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8  # Specify the number of threads for fastp
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name fastp_parallel
#SBATCH -o fastp_parallel.out
#SBATCH -e fastp_parallel.err

module load biocontainers/default 
module load fastp/0.23.2

DATA_FOLDER=/anvil/projects/x-bio240351/instructors_area/fastq/
OUTPUT_FOLDER=/anvil/scratch/$USER/fastp_results

# Create output directory
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_FOLDER

# Array of paired FASTQ file prefixes
PAIRED_FILES=("CH0893_ACCTTGGC-ATGAGGCC_L001"
              "NA5206_AGTTGGCT-GCAACCAT_L003"
              "SE2109_TCAAGGAC-CATTCGTC_L002")
              
# Loop through each pair and process with fastp
for prefix in "${PAIRED_FILES[@]}"; do
    fastp \
        -i ${DATA_FOLDER}/${prefix}_R1_001.fastq.gz \
        -I ${DATA_FOLDER}/${prefix}_R2_001.fastq.gz \
        -o ${OUTPUT_FOLDER}/${prefix}_R1_trimmed.fastq.gz \
        -O ${OUTPUT_FOLDER}/${prefix}_R2_trimmed.fastq.gz \
        --html ${OUTPUT_FOLDER}/${prefix}_fastp_report.html \
        --json ${OUTPUT_FOLDER}/${prefix}_fastp_report.json \
        --thread 8
done
```

**Section 4: Comparing Pre- and Post-Trimming Quality**

**Quality Check on Trimmed Data**

- Rerun FastQC on the trimmed data to confirm improvements:

```bash
fastqc your_data_trimmed.fastq -o fastqc_reports
```

- Compare the pre- and post-trimming reports to evaluate changes in:
- Base quality scores.
- Adapter content.
- Read length distribution.

**Section 5: Practical Workflow**

**Step 1: Initial Inspection**

- Use `wc` and `less` to verify the FASTQ structure and estimate dataset size.

**Step 2: Evaluate Raw Data Quality**

- Run FastQC and interpret the reports for potential issues (e.g., adapters, low-quality bases).

**Step 3: Perform Quality Trimming**

- Use Fastp to remove adapters, trim low-quality bases, and filter short reads.

**Step 4: Re-evaluate Trimmed Data**

- Run FastQC again on trimmed files to confirm quality improvement.

**Section 6: Best Practices for Data Quality**

1.	**Retain Metadata**: Keep logs and summaries from FastQC and Fastp for reproducibility.

2.	**Optimize Parameters**: Tailor Fastp settings (e.g., trimming thresholds) based on FastQC reports.

3.	**Batch Processing**: Use loops or job arrays for large datasets.

4.	**Save Outputs**: Maintain a structured directory with raw, trimmed, and quality-checked data.

**Additional Commands for Troubleshooting**

1.	**Check File Size**:

```bash
ls -lh your_data.fastq
```

2.	**Count Adapters**:

```bash
grep -c "adapter_sequence" your_data.fastq
```

3.	**Extract Read Lengths**:

```bash
awk '(NR%4==2) {print length($0)}' your_data.fastq | sort | uniq -c
```

### Section 7: About demultiplexing sequencing data

**What is Demultiplexing?**

Demultiplexing is the process of separating sequencing reads from a single FASTQ file (or paired FASTQ files) into individual files for each sample. This is achieved using **barcodes**—short DNA sequences unique to each sample.

<aside>
💡

The dataset we are going to work is already demultiplexed, but is good practice to check if this was already performed by the sequencing facility. 

</aside>

Demultiplexing ensures:

- Accurate assignment of reads to samples.
- Removal of barcode sequences from the data.

**Tools for Demultiplexing**

Common tools for demultiplexing include:

1.	**bcl2fastq**: Often used for Illumina data.

2.	**Fastp**: Includes demultiplexing capabilities.

3.	**AdapterRemoval**: Useful for small datasets.

4.	**Custom Scripts**: For specialized needs.

**Demultiplexing with bcl2fastq**

**1. Overview**

bcl2fastq converts Illumina’s raw BCL files into demultiplexed FASTQ files. It also trims barcodes and adapters during this process.

**2. Prerequisites**

- Access to raw BCL files.
- A sample sheet (SampleSheet.csv) containing sample names, barcodes, and metadata.

**3. Running bcl2fastq**

1.	Navigate to the directory with BCL files:

```bash
cd /path/to/bcl/files
```

2.	Run bcl2fastq:

```bash
bcl2fastq --runfolder-dir . --output-dir /path/to/output
```

Key parameters:

•	`--runfolder-dir`: Directory with BCL files.

•	`--output-dir`: Directory for FASTQ output.

3.	Check the output directory for demultiplexed FASTQ files, organized by sample.

**Demultiplexing with Fastp**

If your sequencing output is already in FASTQ format but needs demultiplexing:

**1. Prepare a Barcode File**

Create a text file with sample names and their barcodes:

```bash
sample1    ATCG
sample2    CGTA
sample3    TTAA
```

**2. Run Fastp**

Demultiplex paired-end reads:

```bash
fastp -i input_R1.fastq -I input_R2.fastq \
--demultiplex_barcode_file barcodes.txt \
--out1 demultiplexed_R1.fastq \
--out2 demultiplexed_R2.fastq
```

**Demultiplexing Using Custom Scripts**

For more control, you can use Python or Bash scripts to demultiplex reads based on barcodes. For example:

```bash
grep -A 3 '^@.*ATCG' input.fastq > sample1.fastq
grep -A 3 '^@.*CGTA' input.fastq > sample2.fastq
```

**Quality Control After Demultiplexing**

Once reads are separated:

1.	**Run FastQC**:

```bash
fastqc sample1.fastq -o qc_reports
```

2.	**Trim Adapters** (if not already done during demultiplexing):

```bash
fastp -i sample1.fastq -o sample1_trimmed.fastq
```

**Practical Workflow for Demultiplexing**

1.	**Check Raw Data**: Identify whether the data is in BCL or FASTQ format.

2.	**Choose a Demultiplexing Tool**: Use bcl2fastq for BCL files or fastp/custom scripts for FASTQ files.

3.	**Verify Results**: Confirm that demultiplexed FASTQ files match the sample sheet.

4.	**Run Quality Control**: Use tools like FastQC to assess the quality of the demultiplexed reads.

**Best Practices for Demultiplexing**

1.	**Validate Sample Sheet**: Ensure barcode sequences in the sample sheet are correct.

2.	**Inspect Outputs**: Check the number of reads per sample to identify potential issues.

3.	**Automate**: Use pipelines or scripts for batch processing of large datasets.

4.	**Document Everything**: Keep records of commands, sample sheets, and log files for reproducibility.

Demultiplexing is a critical step in sequencing workflows, enabling accurate downstream analyses. With these tools and strategies, you can efficiently process and prepare your data for quality control and analysis.

### **Section 8: Summary**
