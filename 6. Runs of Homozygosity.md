# ConGen 2025 - Runs of homozygosity tutorial

Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) are defined as the uninterrupted stretches of homozygous genotypes within an individual's genome. These regions can provide valuable insights into the demographic history, inbreeding levels, and disease susceptibility of a population. By analyzing the length and distribution of ROH, we can infer the population structure, migration patterns, and effective population size of a group.

Moreover, ROH can also be used to identify deleterious mutations and genomic regions under positive selection. Inbreeding depression, which is caused by the accumulation of deleterious alleles, can be estimated by measuring the frequency and length of ROH. Longer ROH segments are associated with increased homozygosity and reduced genetic diversity, which can lead to reduced fitness and increased risk of disease.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to estimate ROH using the 'bcftools roh' plugin, which is a widely used tool for detecting ROH from VCF files. We will also discuss the interpretation and application of ROH results in different research contexts, such as conservation genetics, human population genetics, and animal breeding. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of the biological significance and practical utility of ROH analysis.

## a) Calculate RoHs with bcftools

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name roh_bcftools
#SBATCH -A bio240351  # Allocation name
#SBATCH --nodes=1         # Total # of nodes (must be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1        # Total # of MPI tasks (should be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --mem=1G          # Memory allocation
#SBATCH --time=1:30:00    # Total run time limit (hh:mm:ss)
#SBATCH -o /anvil/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME/logs/roh_bcftools.o%j      # Name of stdout output file
#SBATCH -e /anvil/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME/logs/roh_bcftools.e%j      # Name of stderr error file
#SBATCH -p wholenode  # Queue (partition) name

#Load bcftools
module load biocontainers/default
module load bcftools/1.17

#Define path to input files - do not change it
VCF_FILE="/anvil/projects/x-bio240351/shared_data/vcf/elephants.chr.11.12.subset.vcf.gz"

#Define path to save the output files
OUTPUT_PATH="/anvil/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME/06_runs_of_homozygosity"

bcftools roh --AF-dflt 0.4 -I -G30 --rec-rate 1.4e-9 ${VCF_FILE} > ${OUTPUT_PATH}/elephant.roh.txt
```

Make sure you understand each option in the `bcftools` command line:

-   `bcftools roh`: This command runs the `roh` plugin from `bcftools` to detect runs of homozygosity.
-   `-AF-dflt 0.4`: This option sets the default allele frequency to 0.4 when the frequency is missing in the input file.
-   `I`: This option tells the plugin to perform the imputation of missing genotypes.
-   `G30`: This option sets the phred-scaled genotype quality threshold to 30. Genotypes below this quality threshold will be treated as missing.
-   `-rec-rate 1.4e-9`: This option sets the recombination rate to 1.4e-9.

## b) Prepare the output file for plotting

'bcftools roh' will create a long output file, but we are only interested in the “RG”  portion of the files, where it contains the homozygous blocks in the genome. These blocks are important because they are indicative of long stretches of DNA that are identical in the two chromosomes, which can occur when the parents are related. Use the command line below to extract the RoHs:

```bash
grep "RG" elephant.roh.txt | cut -f 2,3,6 > elephant.roh.edited.txt
```

Now use the `awk` command below to add the population origin of each individual:

```bash
awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS="\t"} NR==FNR {if (FNR > 1) pop[$1]=$2; next} FNR==1 {print $0, "Population"} FNR > 1 {print $0, pop[$1]}' /anvil/projects/x-bio240351/shared_data/popfile.txt elephant.roh.edited.txt > elephant.roh.with.population.txt
```

## c) Plot the results using R

Next we will use R to plot the RoH results. You can run these commands on your local computer or in Anvil server.

There are several ways of showing the results, and it will mostly depend on your main question. For example, if you are interested in the frequency of RoHs in different populations, you can create histograms that show the distribution of the length of these blocks. On the other hand, if you want to study the relationship between RoHs and disease, you may want to compare the number and length of RoHs between cases and controls, and perform statistical tests to determine if there is an association. In either case, it is important to consider the study design and the underlying biological mechanisms that could affect the results.

Two of the most basic statistics we can obtain from this analysis are the total number of RoH (NROH) and the sum total length of RoH (SROH). You can use the following R script to estimate these values and plot the results. Don't forget to change the working directory.

```r
# Set the working directory
setwd("/anvil/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME/06_runs_of_homozygosity")

# Load libraries and read data
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

# Read data with read_delim() for better control over input file parsing
roh <- read_delim("elephant.roh.with.population.txt", delim = "\t", skip = 1, col_names = c("Sample", "Chromosome", "RoH_length", "Population"))

# Compute NROH and SROH
nroh <- roh %>% 
  group_by(Sample) %>% 
  summarize(NROH = n())

sroh <- roh %>% 
  group_by(Sample) %>% 
  summarize(SROH = sum(RoH_length))

# Combine population information
data <- inner_join(nroh, sroh, by = "Sample") %>% 
  inner_join(roh %>% select(Sample, Population) %>% distinct(), by = "Sample")

# Inspect the resulting dataset to ensure it is correct
head(data)

# Create the plot using the preprocessed dataset
snroh_plot <- data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SROH, y = NROH, color = Population)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "NROH vs. SROH", color = "Population")

# Print the plot
print(snroh_plot)
ggsave("sroh_nroh.png", snroh_plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

>:elephant::grey_question: How can the comparison between the sum total length of runs of homozygosity (SROH) and the total number of runs of homozygosity (NROH) provide insights into the demographic history of savanna and forest elephants? This [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPbgsvdcFHzU7tLRbjR99shMq8xo06QE/view?usp=sharing) can help you to find an explanation.


Now let’s group the RoH into three categories based on their lengths:
* 500 kb – 1 Mb
* 1 Mb – 2 Mb
* '>2 Mb

> [!IMPORTANT]
> :elephant::grey_question:  Note that the minimum length for considering a segment as a ROH is already relatively long (500 kb). Why do we set this minimum length?
> * According to Ceballos et al. 2018, very short RoHs (tens to hundreds of kb) reflect linkage disequilibrium patterns (that are not always considered autozygous); intermediate RoHs (hundreds of kb to 2 Mb) result from background relatedness owing to genetic drift; and long RoHs (over 1–2Mb) arise from recent parental relatedness. Note that these length thresholds are derived from studies on the human population and may vary significantly between species, depending on factors such as genome size, recombination rates, and heterozygosity. And remember, we can comparing species with very different levels of genetic diversity!

Use the R code below to create categories and plot it.

```r
# Create RoH length categories
roh_categories <- roh %>% 
  mutate(RoH_category = case_when(
      RoH_length >= 500000 & RoH_length < 1000000 ~ "500 kb - 1 Mb",
      RoH_length >= 1000000 & RoH_length < 2000000 ~ "1 Mb - 2 Mb",
      RoH_length >= 2000000 ~ "> 2 Mb",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_ # Assign NA to lengths < 500k)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(RoH_category)) # Remove rows where RoH_category is NA

# Summing RoH_length by Sample, RoH_category, and Population
summed_roh <- roh_categories %>%
  group_by(Sample, RoH_category, Population) %>%
  summarise(total_RoH_length = sum(RoH_length), .groups = "drop")  # Sum the RoH_length for each group

# Create the stacked bar plot
stacked_barplot <- summed_roh %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sample, y = total_RoH_length/1000000, fill = RoH_category)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Population, nrow =1, scales = "free_x") +  # Facet by Population
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
    strip.text = element_text(angle = 90, size = 10)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Total RoH Length (Mb)", fill = "RoH Category")

# Print the plot
print(stacked_barplot)
ggsave("stacked_barplot.png", stacked_barplot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

>:elephant::grey_question: Compare inbreeding level between savanna and forest elephants. When did the inbreeding happen?

Next, let’s estimate the genomic inbreeding coefficient, FROH, for each individual. This metric quantifies the proportion of the autosomal genome that is autozygous. It is calculated as the sum total length of runs of homozygosity (SROH) over a specified minimum length, divided by the total length of the genome analyzed. For this analysis, we will define the minimum ROH length as 1 Mb. Note that the genome size considered corresponds only to the portion included in this tutorial analysis, which is limited to two chromosomes due to constraints on time and resources.

```r
#Estimate FROH

# Define the total genome length in the analysis (in our case, we included only two chromosomes)
total_chromosome_length <- 152468515

# Calculate FROH for each sample
frohs <- roh_categories %>%
  filter(RoH_length > 1000000) %>%  # Only include RoH_length > 1 Mb
  group_by(Sample) %>%              
  summarise(total_RoH_above_1Mb = sum(RoH_length)) %>%  
  mutate(FROH = total_RoH_above_1Mb / total_chromosome_length)  # Calculate FROH

# Join it with the original roh_categories to retain Population information
frohs_with_population <- frohs %>%
  left_join(roh_categories %>% select(Sample, Population) %>% distinct(), by = "Sample")

# Reorder the Sample factor by Population
frohs_with_population$Sample <- factor(frohs_with_population$Sample, 
                                       levels = unique(frohs_with_population$Sample[order(frohs_with_population$Population)]))

# Create a boxplot per population with individual dots per sample
boxplot_froh <- frohs_with_population %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Population, y = FROH, color = Population)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, fill = "transparent", color = "black") +  
  geom_jitter(aes(color = Population), size = 3, width = 0.2) +  
  theme_minimal() +  # Minimal theme for clean visualization
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12), 
    legend.position = "none" ) + 
  labs(y = "FROH", x = "Population")

# Print the plot
print(boxplot_froh)
ggsave("boxplot_froh.png", boxplot_froh, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```
